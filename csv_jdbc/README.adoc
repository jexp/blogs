= A minimum viable JDBC - interaction with Neo4j

With http://neo4j.org/download[Neo4j 2.1] being released, I want to test out how easy it is to interact with the database
purely by means of "standard" database means. That means that communication should go via JDBC, and data import should use
no custom code and an easy data format - CSV.

In Neo4j 2.1, a very interesting new feature is the batch-insertion from text files via the http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/query-load-csv.html[`LOAD CSV FROM`]
Cypher construct. This might seems like a small improvement, but behind the scenes the infrastrcuture to import bigger amounts of data
has been rewritten from the ground up with the promise to transparently not only to be flexible, but also to appraoch the performance
that until now only the Neo4j BatchInserter could devliver, while keeping all transactional goodies intact.
