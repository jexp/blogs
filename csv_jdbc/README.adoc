= A minimum viable JDBC - interaction with Neo4j

With http://neo4j.org/download[Neo4j 2.1] being released, I want to test out how easy it is to interact with the database
purely by means of "standard" Java database APIs. That means that communication should go via JDBC, and data import should use
the standard approach - prepared statements.

For this purpose, the maven project in https://github.com/peterneubauer/blogs/blob/master/csv_jdbc/pom.xml[`pom.xml`] is only minimal to pull in the neo4j and neo4j-jdbc driver artifacts:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

After adding another dependency on JUnit, it is time to write my test class. First, I loaded the driver normally and opened
a connection to my local Neo4j server that I had installed and started on my OSX with

[source,bash]
---
brew install neo4j && neo4j start
