= A minimum viable JDBC - interaction with Neo4j

With http://neo4j.org/download[Neo4j 2.1] being released, I want to test out how easy it is to interact with the database
purely by means of "standard" database means. That means that communication should go via JDBC, and data import should use
the standard approach - prepared statements.

For this purpose, the maven project in `pom.xml` is only minimal to pull in the neo4j and neo4j-jdbc driver artifacts:

[source,xml]
