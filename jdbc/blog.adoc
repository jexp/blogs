= The 10 min Neo4j JDBC setup

Hi all,

Even if http://neo4j.org[Neo4j] is all about graphs, its graph query language http://neo4j.org/learn/cypher[Cypher] is well suited to be used with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). As you probably know JDBC is a common way to connect to a datastore, especially since there
is a lot of tooling and connectors written around it in the Business Intelligence, Data Migration and ETL world.

Following up on our http://neo4j.com/blog/cypher-jdbc-tools-testing-results/[blog post on JDBC tools for Neo4j], I just wanted to check that things are still working well with the recent Neo4j versions. Actually, things are even better now!

The Neo4j JDBC driver works with Neo4j server in version 1.9.x and 2.x and with embedded and in-memory databases (which I'll cover in a later blog-post). It allows you to (transactionally) execute parametrized Cypher statements against your Neo4j database to either query or create data.

To start with, I decided to test a general SQL tool, so I installed Squirrel SQL on http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/#installation[OSX]). Now, in order to connect to Neo4j, I built the Neo4j JDBC driver https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-jdbc[from source], but you can just
download the latest version of the JDBC driver http://m2.neo4j.org/content/repositories/releases/org/neo4j/neo4j-jdbc/2.0.1/neo4j-jdbc-2.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar[here].

Next step is to install Neo4j. On my OSX machine, I simply do

[source, bash]
----
brew install neo4j && neo4j start
open http://localhost:7474/
----

and get to the web interface. In order to be able to see some data, I just insert the Movie-dataset (with +:play movies+) and check that I get something back with one of the standard built-in Cypher queries:

Ok, seems to work! Now on to adding the downloaded Neo4j JDBC driver to SquirrelSQL:

With that, I can just connect to my `http://localhost:7474` Neo4j URL without any authentication (you can add that later).
Now, let's take the same query from the Neo4j Browser and execute it through SquirrelSQL:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a)-[r]->(b)
RETURN DISTINCT head(labels(a)) AS This, type(r) as To, head(labels(b)) AS That
LIMIT 100
----

So, within just a few minutes I can get Neo4j installed, insert some data, and get a standard JDBC client up and running against it. Next we will look at how to do this from a Java program - stay tuned!
